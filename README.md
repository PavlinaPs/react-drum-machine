## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- mobile first approach

### What I learned

```js
const bankOneData = [
  {
    key: "Q",
    code: "KeyQ",
    id: "cowbell",
    audio: require("../assets/audio/bankOne/mixkit-cowbell-sharp-hit-1743.wav"),
  },
```

### Continued development

I need to improve in React.js alone and in combination with Bootstrap & Sass customizations or Tailwind and code more complicated projects.
